    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Our Goal</h2>
    <p> 
      Our goal, by 2027, is to digitally preserve and publish the first-hand account of Wilford Woodruff regarding the Restoration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ from 1833 to 1898. Our aim is to make Wilford Woodruff's faithful records accessible to everyone, inspiring individuals, particularly the younger generation, to study and strengthen their faith in Jesus Christ, comprehend and honor sacred temple commitments, and thereby receive the blessings of eternal life with their families.
      <br><br>
      Brigham Young University - Idaho's Data Science Program and The Research and Business Development Center, in collaboration with The Wilford Woodruff Papers project, are embarking on a journey to integrate data science tools into the editorial process of bringing Wilford Woodruff's writings into the limelight. We utilize our Data Science Society, Senior Projects, and Data Science Consulting Class to accomplish this objective.
